- Functions in Dockerex module should not be exposed, move them to an "internal" module.
- Configuration in Dockerex functions should be moved to config files.
- Think about converting types in Containers.Types and Images.Types to typed structs.
- For the moment, decoding logs depends on config so the container is inspected before processing the response from logs. Maybe, the decoder :logs can be smart enough to guess the format when decode_frame fails.
